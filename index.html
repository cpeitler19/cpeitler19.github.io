            <hr class="light my-4">
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Christina is an 11th grader at Mineola High School. She hasn't been doing computer programming for long, but it already has become a passion of hers, one she wishes to continue throughout her life. When she gets behind a computer, she is able to express herself and create what was a idea into a realty. Other passions of hers is writing, especially creative writing. Christina is apart of the school newspaper and wrote several articles in her local town paper. She uses her creativity in her writing and in computer programming which helps give her innovative ideas. She also plays three sports for her school, volleyball, bowling and softball. Another huge part of her life is music. She plays the clarinet and is part of many extra curricular activities for music. She was the youngest musician in her school's pit band for the school's musical. Their are countless other interest and activities Christina is apart of but perhaps her greatest pride is her participation in Girl Scouts. Currently she is working towards her gold award and works at a Girl Scout camp over the summer since she was a freshmen. Though she doesn't have many technical achievements yet, but she is striving towards her goals and making herself more involved and experienced with programming everyday. She has just submitted an app into a National Congressional App competition. Her app is raising awareness of equality in the community and for people to freely express their difficulties involving race in the community. This is her greatest technical accomplishment because not only was it a challenge she was able to overcome but she was helping the community and a current world issue at the same time. Christina is a junior in high school but she has aspirations to attend college. Christina is definitely going to college for computer science so she can procure a profession in the industry. Her future plans is to have a stable job that she loves. She hopes her future and job won't just change her life, but change the world around her.
